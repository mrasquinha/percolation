For class Percolation use the inputs in percolation-testing.zip.
Random inputs can also be used in the test case (see useInputTxt).
PercolationVisualizer and its interactive version in percolation-testing.zip
are both useful tools for testing. If the input grid is large, save the image and
diff against the reference image.
